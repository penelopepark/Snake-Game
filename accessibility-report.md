# **Question 2**

If I were to market my Snake Game, the primary audience would be gamers of all 
ages. This game would appeal to individuals who enjoy simple, fast-paced games 
who are looking for a short break. Since the game is easy to learn and intuitive, 
people of all ages will be able to enjoy! The game could also appeal to families, 
as the game is accessible and can be used for a friendly competition using the 
score leaderboard.

# **Question 3**

There are definitely certain demographics that might be less likely to use my 
Snake Game due to accessibility barriers or lack of appeal. For instance, 
individuals with visual impairments such as colourblindness will struggle 
with viewing the different elements on the screen, such as a snake, food, 
or the wall. Additionally, although people who are deaf will still be able
to view the screen and play the game, people who are blind will not be able
to play the game at all. Similarly, players with physical disabilities may
not be able to use standard keyboards to control the snake. In fact, this 
game may not be appealing at all to certain groups of people! People who 
enjoy more complex, intense games will not enjoy the game as much as others
who prefer simple, easy games like my Snake Game. To address these barriers,
I could incorporate features like being able to control the snake using voice
commands, or adding more features such as difficulty levels or story mode.
